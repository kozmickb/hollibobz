# TripTick Interactive Checklist Feature

## Example Usage

When a user asks HollyBobz for an itinerary like:
> "Can you create a 3-day itinerary for Paris?"

HollyBobz will automatically receive enhanced instructions to format the response with both human-readable content and structured JSON.

## Expected AI Response Format

```
Here's your perfect 3-day Paris adventure! ðŸ—¼

**Day 1** will focus on the classic landmarks - you'll start with the iconic Eiffel Tower in the morning when crowds are lighter, then stroll along the Seine to the Louvre for an afternoon of world-class art.

**Day 2** takes you to charming Montmartre with its cobblestone streets and the stunning SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur, followed by exploring the trendy Marais district.

**Day 3** rounds out your trip with a peaceful morning at Luxembourg Gardens and some shopping along the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es.
